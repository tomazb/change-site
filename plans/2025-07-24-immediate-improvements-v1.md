# Immediate Improvements Implementation Plan

**Date:** 2025-07-24  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Branch:** develop  

## Overview

Implementation plan for the four immediate next steps identified for the change-site.sh project:

1. Configuration file support
2. Rollback functionality  
3. Enhanced integration testing
4. Performance optimization

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Configuration File Support

**Objective:** Add support for configuration files to store common settings

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create configuration file format (.conf)
- [ ] Add configuration file parsing functions
- [ ] Support for subnet pair definitions
- [ ] Environment variable support
- [ ] Profile-based configurations
- [ ] Update help and documentation

**Files to modify:**
- `change-site.sh` - Add config parsing functions
- `README.md` - Document configuration options
- Create example configuration files

### 2. Rollback Functionality

**Objective:** Implement automatic rollback capability for failed operations

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Enhanced backup metadata tracking
- [ ] Rollback command implementation
- [ ] Automatic rollback on failure option
- [ ] Rollback verification
- [ ] Integration with existing backup system

**Files to modify:**
- `change-site.sh` - Add rollback functions
- `test-change-site.sh` - Add rollback tests

### 3. Enhanced Integration Testing

**Objective:** Improve testing coverage and add integration tests

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Mock NetworkManager environment
- [ ] Container-based testing
- [ ] Multi-connection scenarios
- [ ] Error condition testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

**Files to modify:**
- `test-change-site.sh` - Enhanced test cases
- Create new integration test files

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Objective:** Add parallel processing for multiple connections

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Parallel connection processing
- [ ] Progress indicators
- [ ] Resource management
- [ ] Performance metrics
- [ ] Configurable concurrency

**Files to modify:**
- `change-site.sh` - Add parallel processing
- Update tests for parallel operations

## Success Criteria

- All new features work without breaking existing functionality
- Comprehensive test coverage for new features
- Documentation updated for all new capabilities
- RHEL 8-10 compatibility maintained
- Performance improvements measurable

## Timeline

- Configuration file support: Priority 1
- Rollback functionality: Priority 2  
- Enhanced testing: Priority 3
- Performance optimization: Priority 4

## Notes

- Implement incrementally with testing at each step
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code style and patterns
