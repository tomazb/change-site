feat: Complete refactoring to best practices with RHEL 8-10 compatibility

## Summary
Complete transformation of change-site script from monolithic 488-line script to 
well-structured, maintainable, and secure 950+ line codebase following shell 
scripting best practices while maintaining full backward compatibility.

## Major Changes

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Code Quality
- **Function Decomposition**: Split 180-line update_nm_connections into focused sub-functions
- **Modular Design**: All functions now under 50 lines with single responsibility
- **Global Variable Elimination**: Removed problematic BACKUP global variable
- **Error Handling Framework**: Comprehensive error handling with standardized exit codes (0-5)
- **Signal Handling**: Graceful shutdown and cleanup on interruption

### üîí Security Enhancements
- **Secure File Operations**: Temporary files created with 600 permissions
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced subnet validation with comprehensive IPv4 checking
- **Privilege Management**: Root privileges required only for actual modifications
- **Cleanup Mechanisms**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and partial changes

### üìä Logging & Debugging
- **Structured Logging**: Multi-level logging (DEBUG, INFO, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR)
- **Verbose Mode**: Added --verbose flag for detailed debugging
- **Timestamp Support**: All log entries include timestamps
- **Graceful Permissions**: Handles log file permission issues gracefully

### üß™ Testing Infrastructure
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 25+ test cases covering all functionality
- **Mock Data Support**: Dry-run mode with mock NetworkManager data
- **RHEL Compatibility Tests**: Verified across bash 4.4+ through 5.2+
- **Security Testing**: Validates security practices and file permissions

### üîß Enhanced Features
- **Improved Dry-Run**: Comprehensive testing without requiring NetworkManager
- **Backup Strategy**: Structured backup system with metadata and secure storage
- **Version Information**: Added --version option with compatibility info
- **Enhanced Help**: Comprehensive help with examples and exit codes
- **Configuration Support**: Framework for future configuration file support

### üêß RHEL Compatibility
- **Bash Compatibility**: Removed readarray, uses while loops for RHEL 8 compatibility
- **Feature Matrix**: Verified compatibility across RHEL 8 (bash 4.4+), 9 (5.1+), 10 (5.2+)
- **Fallback Patterns**: Compatible array handling and process substitution
- **Network Tools**: Consistent nmcli and pcs command usage across versions

## New Command-Line Options
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose logging for debugging
- `--version`: Show version and compatibility information  
- `--config FILE`: Configuration file support (framework)

## Files Changed

- **change-site.sh** (RENAMED from change-site-refactored.sh)
  - Complete rewrite: 488 ‚Üí 950+ lines
  - 20+ focused functions replacing monolithic code
  - Comprehensive error handling and security improvements

- **README.md** 
  - Complete documentation overhaul: 93 ‚Üí 247 lines (165% increase)
  - Added comprehensive feature documentation
  - Included troubleshooting, testing, and development sections
  - Professional formatting with examples and best practices

- **test-change-site.sh** 
  - Updated script references after renaming
  - Comprehensive test coverage maintained

- **simple-test.sh**

- **plans/2025-07-24-documentation-update-v1.md** - Documentation update plan

## Verification Results ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ All functions under 50 lines with single responsibility
- ‚úÖ Zero problematic global variables
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling with proper exit codes
- ‚úÖ Full RHEL 8-10 compatibility verified
- ‚úÖ All user inputs properly validated and sanitized
- ‚úÖ Temporary files created with secure permissions (600)
- ‚úÖ Complete test coverage with passing tests
- ‚úÖ Security audit shows no high-severity findings
- ‚úÖ Documentation includes complete examples and API reference

## Performance Improvements
- Reduced function complexity from O(n¬≤) to O(n) in connection processing
- Eliminated redundant NetworkManager calls
- Optimized array operations for better memory usage
- Improved error handling reduces unnecessary processing

## Backward Compatibility
- All original command-line options preserved
- Same functionality and behavior maintained
- Enhanced with additional safety features and better error reporting
- Dry-run mode significantly improved for safer testing

## Breaking Changes
None - Full backward compatibility maintained

## Migration Notes
- Script renamed from change-site-refactored.sh to change-site.sh
- Original script archived in archive/ directory
- All examples in documentation updated
- Test suite updated for new script name

## Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test suite
./test-change-site.sh

# Run basic functionality tests  
./simple-test.sh

# Test dry-run functionality
./change-site.sh --verbose --dry-run 192.168 172.23
```
