# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document describes the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline implemented for the change-site project.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline consists of three main workflows:

1. **CI Pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) - Continuous Integration
2. **Release Management** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) - Automated releases
3. **Maintenance** (`.github/workflows/maintenance.yml`) - Dependency updates and security

## CI Pipeline

### Triggers
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` branch
- Release publications

### Jobs

#### 1. Lint and Syntax Check
- **Purpose**: Validate shell script quality and syntax
- **Tools**: shellcheck, bash syntax validation
- **Scope**: All `.sh` files in the repository

#### 2. Test Suite
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing across multiple scenarios
- **Strategy**: Matrix testing with three test suites
  - `basic`: Core functionality tests
  - `integration`: Configuration and rollback tests
  - `enhanced`: Mock environments and performance tests
- **Dependencies**: NetworkManager, jq
- **Artifacts**: Test results uploaded for analysis

#### 3. Security Scan
- **Purpose**: Vulnerability detection and security validation
- **Tool**: Trivy scanner
- **Output**: SARIF format uploaded to GitHub Security tab
- **Scope**: Filesystem scan for vulnerabilities

#### 4. Documentation Check
- **Purpose**: Ensure documentation completeness and quality
- **Validation**: 
  - Required documentation files presence
  - Markdown linting with markdownlint
- **Configuration**: `.markdownlint.json`

#### 5. Build and Package
- **Purpose**: Create distributable packages
- **Triggers**: Push events and releases
- **Output**: 
  - Compressed tarball with all necessary files
  - SHA256 checksums for verification
- **Artifacts**: Release packages uploaded

#### 6. Deploy to Staging
- **Purpose**: Automated staging deployment
- **Trigger**: Push to `develop` branch
- **Environment**: `staging` (requires manual approval)
- **Process**: Download artifacts and deploy to staging

#### 7. Release
- **Purpose**: Publish official releases
- **Trigger**: Release publication
- **Process**: Upload build artifacts to GitHub release

#### 8. Notification
- **Purpose**: Status reporting
- **Conditions**: Always runs after all jobs
- **Output**: Success/failure notifications

## Release Management

### Manual Trigger Workflow
The release workflow is manually triggered through GitHub Actions with the following inputs:

- **Version**: Target version (e.g., v1.2.0)
- **Release Type**: patch, minor, or major
- **Pre-release**: Boolean flag for pre-release marking

### Release Process

#### 1. Version Validation
- Validates version format (vX.Y.Z)
- Checks for existing tags
- Prevents duplicate releases

#### 2. Version Updates
- Updates `VERSION` variable in `change-site.sh`
- Updates current version in `README.md`
- Commits changes to develop branch

#### 3. Release Creation
- Creates Git tag with release version
- Generates comprehensive release notes
- Creates GitHub release with artifacts
- Merges to main branch (for stable releases)

#### 4. Post-Release Tasks
- Updates development version for next iteration
- Creates milestone for next version
- Prepares develop branch for continued development

### Release Notes Generation
Automated release notes include:
- Release type and version information
- New features and improvements
- Technical details and compatibility
- Installation and verification instructions

## Maintenance Workflows

### Dependency Updates (Weekly)
- **Schedule**: Sundays at 2 AM UTC
- **Process**:
  - Check GitHub Actions versions
  - Validate system dependencies
  - Update documentation tools
  - Create automated PRs for updates

### Security Audit
- **Frequency**: Weekly and on-demand
- **Scope**:
  - Shell script security scanning
  - File permission validation
  - Secret detection
  - Vulnerability assessment

### Compatibility Testing
- **Matrix**: Multiple bash versions (4.4, 5.0, 5.1, 5.2)
- **Validation**:
  - Syntax compatibility
  - Feature compatibility
  - RHEL version support

### Performance Benchmarking
- **Metrics**:
  - Execution time measurement
  - Memory usage analysis
  - Performance regression detection
- **Tools**: `time`, `/usr/bin/time -v`

### Documentation Synchronization
- **Validation**:
  - Version consistency checks
  - Link validation
  - Documentation metrics generation

## Configuration Files

### `.markdownlint.json`
Markdown linting configuration with project-specific rules:
- Line length: 120 characters
- Disabled rules for code blocks and tables
- Allows HTML tags for enhanced formatting

### Workflow Security
- **Permissions**: Minimal required permissions
- **Secrets**: Uses GitHub token for authenticated operations
- **Environment Protection**: Staging environment requires manual approval

## Integration Points

### GitHub Features
- **Security Tab**: Vulnerability scan results
- **Releases**: Automated release creation
- **Artifacts**: Build and test result storage
- **Environments**: Staging deployment protection

### External Tools
- **Trivy**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Shellcheck**: Shell script linting
- **Markdownlint**: Documentation validation

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow
1. Work on feature branches
2. Create PR to `develop` branch
3. CI pipeline validates changes
4. Merge to `develop` triggers staging deployment
5. Use release workflow for production releases

### Version Management
- Follow semantic versioning (SemVer)
- Use release workflow for all version bumps
- Maintain version consistency across files
- Create meaningful release notes

### Security
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated security scanning
- File permission validation
- Secret detection and prevention

### Quality Assurance
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Multi-environment compatibility testing
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation validation

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Pipeline Status
- All jobs report status to GitHub
- Failed pipelines block merges
- Notification system for status updates

### Artifact Management
- Build artifacts stored with checksums
- Test results preserved for analysis
- Release packages automatically attached

### Environment Health
- Staging deployment validation
- Performance regression detection
- Security vulnerability monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Test Failures
- Check test logs in artifacts
